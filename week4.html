			The amber droplet hung from the <b>branch</b>, reaching <i>fullness and ready</i> to drop. It waited. While many of the other droplets were <u>satisfied</u> to form as big as they could and release, this droplet had other plans. <font>It wanted to be part of history.</font> It wanted to be <em>remembered</em> long after all the other droplets had dissolved into history. So it waited for the perfect specimen to fly by to trap and capture that it hoped would eventually be discovered hundreds of years in the future.
